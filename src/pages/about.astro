          <p>
            I have made significant contributions to web development projects
            using various technologies and frameworks. At AuthorCafé, I built a
            Node.js-based software for automation testing, reducing testing time
            by 50%. Additionally, my work with a team of five members on the UI
            and functional elements of the AuthorCafé product using draft.js and
            React resulted in a 40% increase in company revenue. I also
            collaborated with the design team to create mockups, layouts, and
            wireframes, contributing to the design phase of the software
            development lifecycle.
          </p>
          <p>
            During my time at Toppr, I focused on enhancing the quality and
            performance of the website. By developing UI components with React,
            I achieved a 30% improvement in quality and a 10% boost in system
            performance. Furthermore, I implemented the 'Courses' feature,
            streamlining the user experience and making it more intuitive.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout my career, I have worked with the MERN stack, building
            seamless and responsive web applications. I have also developed APIs
            using Node.js and Express, ensuring secure data transfer and
            seamless integration between front-end and back-end systems. By
            conducting thorough code reviews and providing valuable feedback, I
            improved code quality by 20% and reduced production bugs.
            Additionally, I prioritized security protocols, utilized Git for
            version control, actively participated in team meetings, and
            contributed to documentation efforts.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have expertise in web development, including technologies such as
            HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js, Docker, Jenkins, Python, and
            the MERN stack. I have consistently delivered high-quality code,
            improved system performance, and contributed to the success of
            projects through collaboration, attention to detail, and a
            dedication to creating exceptional user experiences.
